appMobi zxing is aslightly stripped down version with zxing branding removed

in order to build the jar to be included with appmobi, build the project in eclipse, then cd to $ZXING/android/bin and do:
 jar cvf zxing.jar ./*
 
 then move the resulting jar file to $appMobiLib/libs - you may need to do a clean after this
