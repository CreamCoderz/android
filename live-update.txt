The appMobi platform has an ability to "live update" your application after it has already
been installed on a user's device. This is made available via our Cloud and XDK to allow for instant
updates that don't require any additional approvals or delays.

This system can be configured to use third-party hosting instead of appMobi's Cloud.  In this document
we will describe how to setup live updates for your application that uses your own hosting/infrastructure.
There are several things that are needed to make this work and we will walk through them now.

1) Designate a directory on your server/hosting, e.g. http://www.myserver.com/myapp

2) Modify the appconfig.xml found in the AppLab directory on iOS or the AppLab/res/raw
directory on Android. Let's look at the appconfig below:

<XML>
<CONFIG appname="name.mytestapp" title="" type="APP" pkgname="PRODUCTION" release="3.4.0" revision="4">
<BUNDLE base="http://www.myserver.com/myapp" file="bundle.zip" version="1" />
<JAVASCRIPT platform="iphone" version="3.3.0" url="http://assets.edge.flycast.fm/appmobi/javascript/iPhone/3.4.0/appmobi_iphone.js" />
<JAVASCRIPT platform="android" version="3.3.0" url="http://assets.edge.flycast.fm/appmobi/javascript/Android/3.4.0/appmobi_android.js" />
<SECURITY hasCaching="1" hasStreaming="1" hasAnalytics="0" hasPushNotify="0" hasInAppPay="0" hasAdvertising="0" hasLiveUpdate="1" hasOAuth="0" />
<UPDATE type="1" message="Message to user about this live update."/>
</CONFIG>
</XML>

Several things to notice here. The first important node in the XML is BUNDLE. The base attribute will point to the
root directory you designated in Step 1. The version number should be set to 1 initially.

3) Now must save this appconfig.xml back to the project before you submit it to the mobile device store.
Also copy your updated bundle.zip (see get-started.txt) and this updated appconfig.xml to your webserver/hosting
that was designated in Step 1. In this example, the following URLs would be valid and contain these files:
http://www.myserver.com/myapp/bundle.zip
http://www.myserver.com/myapp/appconfig.xml

4) When your app starts, the code will look in BUNDLE->base to see if there is a live update available.
An update is available when the BUNDLE->version from the hosting is greater than the one cached on disk
(the first time your app is run, the appconfig.xml that was bundled in the project that you submitted
to the mobile device store is extracted and cached on disk).
 
Below is a modified version of the appconfig.xml that will cause an update. This change is made on your hosting at
the location http://www.myserver.com/myapp/appconfig.xml
Obviously, the point of this update is to have a new bundle.zip be installed on device so don't forget to update that
before you modify the appconfig.xml on your server.

<XML>
<CONFIG appname="name.mytestapp" title="" type="APP" pkgname="PRODUCTION" release="3.4.0" revision="4">
<BUNDLE base="http://www.myserver.com/myapp" file="bundle.zip" version="2" />
<JAVASCRIPT platform="iphone" version="3.3.0" url="http://assets.edge.flycast.fm/appmobi/javascript/iPhone/3.4.0/appmobi_iphone.js" />
<JAVASCRIPT platform="android" version="3.3.0" url="http://assets.edge.flycast.fm/appmobi/javascript/Android/3.4.0/appmobi_android.js" />
<SECURITY hasCaching="1" hasStreaming="1" hasAnalytics="0" hasPushNotify="0" hasInAppPay="0" hasAdvertising="0" hasLiveUpdate="1" hasOAuth="0" />
<UPDATE type="1" message="Update to change pricing and fix calculation bug."/>
</CONFIG>
</XML>

As you can see we modified BUNDLE->version to be 2 which will cause people to get the new bundle.zip and
appconfig.xml the next time your app is run. There are four types of updates available by setting UPDATE->type to 1-4.
UPDATE->message is just a string that is displayed to the user describing the update that is being installed.
More information about the types can be found in the documentation at http://www.appmobi.com

NOTE: If you do rebuild your app for the mobile device store, update the appconfig.xml in the source project to have
the current version or existing users will get an update as soon as it is started. You will also be updating your bundle.zip

NOTE: Placing a new bundle.zip in your hosting location will not cause a live update. You must also update appconfig.xml
